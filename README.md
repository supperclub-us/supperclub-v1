# supperclub

## Intro
 Are you a foodie looking for fresh culinary experiences, but don't know where to find them? supperclub connects you with local chefs hosting events interested in sharing their passion and creativity. Find new foods and share new cultures today.

## Technologies
We used a variety of technologies to build supperclub. One of the central features was the Mapbox API to filter events in the database by location and populate markers and events. For standardized styling we used Material UI. We also incorporated extra features like the Stripe API to simulate payments, and Cloudinary API to upload photo URL's to our app. We learned about the planning stage of the project, as well as how to more efficiently collaborate through task delegation and Github procedures.
